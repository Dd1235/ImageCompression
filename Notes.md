### Structure Plan

- Make notes of all my learnings
- Implement along the way

- folders will have a __init__.py file and become a package
- external libraries in requirement.txt

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- install project in editable mode `pip install -e .`
- Load configurations dynamically as `from config.config import Config`
- dataset/grascale downloaded from pexels
